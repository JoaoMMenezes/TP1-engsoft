## Repository clonning

# First step in your terminal, install git:
    $sudo apt install git
# Second, go to the directory that you want to have the repository clone:
    $git init
# Third, on the same folder:
    $git clone https://github.com/JoaoMMenezes/TP1-engsoft.git

## Before proceeding, you will need to create a SSH key to link to your GitHub account

#   1.  Check for existing SSH keys: First, check to see if you already have SSH keys on your machine. 
        Open your terminal and type the following command:
        $ls -al ~/.ssh
        This command will list all the files in your SSH directory, including any existing SSH keys. 
        If you see files named id_rsa.pub or id_dsa.pub, then you already have SSH keys.

#   2.  Generate a new SSH key: If you don't have an SSH key, or you want to use a new one, 
        you can generate a new one by running the following command:
        $ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
        I used my example@ufmg.br which was linked to my GitHub account.
        This command will prompt you to enter a file name for the key (press enter to accept the default), 
        and then to enter a passphrase (this is optional, but recommended for added security). 
        Once you have entered this information, your new SSH key will be generated.

#   3.  Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent: Once you have generated an SSH key, you need to add it to the ssh-agent, 
        which is a program that manages SSH keys. Run the following command to add your key:
        $eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
        $ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        This will start the ssh-agent, and then add your new SSH key to it.

#   4.  Add your SSH key to your GitHub account: Next, you need to add your SSH key to your GitHub account so that
        GitHub can recognize your key and allow you to access your repositories. 
        To do this, go to your GitHub account settings, click on "SSH and GPG keys", and then click "New SSH key". 
        Give your key a title, and then copy and paste the contents of your id_ed25519.pub file into the "Key" field. 
        Click "Add SSH key" to save your key.

#   5.  Test your SSH connection: Finally, you can test your SSH connection by running the following command:
        $ssh -T git@github.com
        This command will attempt to connect to your GitHub account using your SSH key.
        If it is your first time, it will ask an yes or no question, type yes. 
        If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message that says 
        "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access." 
        This means that your SSH authentication is working properly.

#   6.  Once you have completed these steps, you should be able to push your changes to your GitHub repository using SSH authentication. 
        When you run git push, Git will use your SSH key to authenticate with GitHub and allow you to push your changes to the repository.

## Adding changes to the repository, example

#       Use the command git config --global --add safe.directory /path/to/your/repository to give you access to add, commit and pull.
#       Use the command git config --global user.name "Your Name" or 
#       git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com" with your GitHub account to enable the commit and pull.

#   1.  Type git add README.md to stage the changes you made to the file.
#   2.  Type git commit -m "Update README.md" to commit the changes to your local repository. 
        Be sure to replace "Update README.md" with a brief description of the changes you made.
#   3.  Finally, type git push to push the changes to your remote repository on GitHub. The command line for this is:
        $git push origin main
        If it is not in the main branch, change to its respective branch's name.
        You may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password and it means that you do not create
        your SSH or is using a token and it is going to give you an error.
        If you have already created one SSH and it is still giving an error, try to use in the main folder this command:
        $git remote set-url origin git@github.com:JoaoMMenezes/TP1-engsoft.git
        Everything should be working fine after those step, but if it is still giving error, change this .txt with
        the solution that you have found.
